# TinyStepper_28BYJ_48 - Arduino Library


This Arduino library is used to control one or more *28BYJ-48* stepper motors.  These motors are very small with a built in gear reduction.  The advantage of these motors is that they are inexpensive and easily available on Amazon.  Their downside is that they're very slow (0.3 revolutions/second max), and only suitable for light-duty applications.  

The primary advantage of using this stepper library with the 28BYJ-48 motors is easy control and faster speeds.  This is achieved by accelerating and decelerating the motor as they travel to their destination.
